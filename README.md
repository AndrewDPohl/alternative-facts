# Alternative Facts

## Making America Great Again, One Falsehood At A Time

Inspired by the first "unofficial" press briefing by the Trump administration, this Ruby on Rails application allows a user to present their own versions of reality for all to see and share.  Very much open to contributions to this project!

Clone this repo, run bundle install, and run rake db:migrate to set up the database tables

Utilizing the Devise gem for Authentication, CanCanCan gem for Authorization, Bootswatch-rails gem for some basic design templating

Added Disqus commented tool to each individual "Fact" instead of rolling our own
